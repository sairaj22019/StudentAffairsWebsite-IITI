          When it comes to studying at an IIT, people have the misconception that IITians are studious dweebs, who can't break out of the humdrum monotony of their schedules; trapped in a perpetual loop of assignments, quizzes, vivas and semester examinations. With a panoply of activities organised under the banner of cultural and technical events, to a multitude of clubs that help the students follow their interests, the students gain an impressive repertoire of skills, apart from academic excellence. Whether it be the performance at inter-IITs, at annual TvsMs, or international competitions, the students at IITI have consistently shone with full brilliance. With a close-knit community of more than 1800 students, students here form strong and lasting friendships for life.
